Yesterday I finished the etherium whitepaper, today I read about proof-of-stake and how it is different and better than proof-of-work.
I am quite excited! It is very interesting and not energy intensive, a combination rare and cool to investigate.

I should check this out maybe: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth, its a 100% Rust actually production ready etherium node implementation.
