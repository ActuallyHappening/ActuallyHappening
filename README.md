# Caleb Yates
Hey!
I'm an enthusiastic programmer, who spends his free time integrating Rust crates together to build really cool things!
I contract for a Web3 company [Salt](salt.space) and work casually at a local programming company [MFDC](https://mfdc.io/), as well as on many side projects that have collectively taught me most of what I know today about programming.
I am currently interested in the understanding and usage of Web3 concepts such as trustless cryptograph, zero knowledge (ZK), and decentralisation, and I have experience in fullstack development.

## Current work

### Dev. Rel. for Salt.space
Early 2025 I was introduced into the world of crypto and Web3 for which I know I will never turn back!
This was through [salt.space](https://salt.space), a self-custodiam MPC platform with fixed fees.
I have written NodeJS (ethersjs) and Rust ([alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/#overview)) EVM blockchain integrations, as well as integrating their [sdk](https://salt-sdk-docs.edd.deno.net/classes/Salt.html#transfer) with an ever-growing list of third party protocols.
And, during the ETHGlobal 2025 hackathon, I taught myself to write Solidity and Noir (ZK), and how to publish smart contracts and verify circuits on chain!

### Web2 with MFDC
Late 2022 I was brought on as a casual employee of [MFDC](https://mfdc.io/) and through them have been taught fullstack development in practise.
My experience includes `vue`JS (v2 and v3), NodeJS, and self-hosting with `pm2`.
I can design WASM and JavaScript frontends and backends, although I detest the state of Web2 (browsers, HTML, CSS, JS) and prefer the consensus of EVM with the security of Ethereum.

### Past side projects

## Schoolbox Styling
During high school I built a small chrome extension to change the colours of SchoolBox, an LMS our school used. It quickly grew in popularity, now it has over a hundred users spread across various schools in Australia and New Zealand.
Such a simple solution, but I designed it to be transparent and automatic, so once you've installed it, it will silently sync between devices and just keep working.
I wanted to mention this because it was the first time a project I had built directly impacted the lives of people I had never met before, and because it used a very-hacky method of integrating [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) with the [JS chrome extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api) that I still get Github issue emails from to this day ;)

## ChessBois
Around the same time, me and a couple other friends entered a competition called the [Mathematics and Statistics Research Competition (MSRC)](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/outreach/mathematics-and-statistics-research-challenge). We won the Queensland Prize, and are now [published](https://terra-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/IJHSR/Articles/volume7-issue3/IJHSR_2025_73_71.pdf), but my favourite part is the app I built which can be viewed in website form here: https://caleb-msrc-q11.netlify.app/. It is 100% Rust, uses a 3D game engine library called [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), and was an invaluable tool that has not been made before (to my knowledge).
I needed to know the maths behind what I was building, but the success of that paper taught me the potential benefits of combining that domain-specific knowledge with good programming skills, which is more than just the best of both worlds.
