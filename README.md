## Caleb Yates
Hey!
I'm an enthusiastic programmer, who spends most of his free time integrating Rust crates together to build really cool things!
I've worked part time at a local programming company [MFDC](https://mfdc.io/), for myself in a growing [partnership](https://www.jordanyatesdirect.com/about#About%20Us), and on many side projects that have collectively taught me most of what I know today about programming.

## Schoolbox Styling
In Grade 10 I built a small chrome extension to change the colours of SchoolBox, a LMS our school used. It quickly grew in popularity, now it has over a hundred users spread across various schools in Ausrtalia and New Zealand.
Such a simple solution, but I designed it to be transparent and automatic, so once you've installed it, it will silently sync between devices and just keep working.

I wanted to mention this because it was the first time a project I had built directly impacted the lives of people I had never met before, and because it used a very-hacky method of integrating [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) with the [JS chrome extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api) that I still get Github issue emails from to this day ;)

## ChessBois
Around the same time, me and a couple other friends entered a competition called the [Mathematics and Statistics Research Competition (MSRC)](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/outreach/mathematics-and-statistics-research-challenge). We won the Queensland Prize, and are now [having it being published](https://ijhsr.terrajournals.org/), but my favourite part is the app I built which can be viewed in website form here: https://caleb-msrc-q11.netlify.app/. It is 100% Rust, uses a 3D game engine library called [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), and was an invaluable tool that has not been made before (to my knowledge).
I needed to know the maths behind what I was building, but the success of that paper taught me the potential benefits of combining that domain-specific knowledge with good programming skills, which is more than just the best of both worlds.


## JYD
Now I'm building a really cool 100% Rust ecommerce website from scratch.
I really enjoy building things without any tutorials, it forces you to solve already known problems and really makes you appreciate your solutions.
I've noticed that my solutions to many existing problems have matched 'industry standard' almost exactly, it is very satisfying to listen to other devs talk about problems in the companie's codebase that I solved myself just the other week.

Building it in 100% Rust means I have had to seriously challenge myself, as when I first began many important projects were still starting out.
I'm keeping the source code closed-source for the moment, because I don't want other people to naively benefit from the many hours of effort by just copy-pasting my work!
But I can say the tech stack I'm using:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), a strongly-typed fine-grained reactivity isomorphic web framework; Integrating with its reactivity implementation has taught me a lot about how reactivity is implemented in other frameworks (such as VueJS and React) beacuse it is done in a strongly-typed manner, and is no nonsense about error (panics, not loosey-goosey JS errors, will happen if you do something wrong)
- [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/), a 100% Rust database implementation; I've absolutely abused this libraries epic live updating features even when [internal bugs surface](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/4921#issuecomment-2754496703), and I've designed my own in-house integration between surrealdb and leptos so that the UI with fine-grained reactivity updates on WebSocket-pushed database updates!
- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), a really good shell implementation in Rust; This shell takes the best of shell scripting and adds structured datatypes, which is the only way I'll ever write scripts again
- [BinaryLane](https://www.binarylane.com.au) for self hosting, using simple-hosting solutions is for people with no time on their hands ;)

## YMap
And finally, this is a rather grandious idea of mine that I've started to build three times now, each time hitting a wall because of my own lack of knowledge in programming.
Its a note taking app that supports the Apple Pen's double tap functionaliy [(which is a features I would need to manually implement at a low level)](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/3768) to provide an alternative to MS OneNote where you would be in control of your own data, e.g. self-hosting. This may go somewhere, but the repository has three branches trying three approaches, all requiring just a bit too much time to get working well for me at the moment.
If I was to pick one project to spend the rest of my life on, at the moment, it would be this one.
