# The ideal abstraction
**There is no ideal abstraction, except the absence of one to provide the flexibillity of chosing your own.** (my own quote)
I think the above quote reflected my thinking as of a while ago, but it's kind of cool anyway.
It's wrong because hardware needs to be usable instantly, which requires an agreement between hardware and software which we must call an abstraction.
Remove the words "hardware" and "software" with "ko'a" and "ko'e" and you get the core problem, that you need
an agreement or protocol or abstracting between ko'a and ko'e for ko'e to work easily and as intended.
The key to the ideal abstraction is not in the creation or removal of the abstraction, but in ***the naming and falsification of the abstraction***.

This is the core element of my thinking: ***Naming*** abstractions and ***falsifying*** abstractions.
The answer is a natural language which is precise (called Lojban),
and an ethos of application (of Lojban) which is falsifiable and constantly falsified.

## Naming: Lojban
English is a terrible natural human language for making precise enough for computers.
The value add of AI is in part because it can make precise human language,
e.g. saying "Hey Siri, set a 10 minute timer" could be identical to `setTimer(10, Minutes)`, but one is intrinsically precise while the other requires AI to be.
The solution to this is obvious in hindsight: construct a precise human language, and program computers in this language.
The existing conlang used for this purpose is called Lojban.
There are many other problems Lojban would solve:

- It can be precisely translated into all normal human languages by default,
instead of favouring English, as Lojban is not English, so as a native English
speaker everything will be easier with an alternative translation shown at all meta levels
which provides a robust system for translation that Spanish and other languages can
take advantage of.
- It can express thoughts as spoken by people that are now multi-lingual at all meta levels,
so that conferences (probably a stretch) or online videos can be precise in their original
recordings rather than requiring translations done after the fact.



## Falsification: Decentralized, low trust continuous falsification
Given a computer is instructed at all meta-levels in Lojban, and abstractions are designed and implemented,
we need a new internet.
Communication mediums exist but there is no open standard for web networks to use them.
I do not understand how the IP / Internetting protocols work but I kinda want to build a new Internet anyway
that is hobbyist friendly.
That way if I create my own communication medium I can design my own working integration with this Internet.

### Continuous falsification
Ideally anybody can run "test" or what I call falsifications (as a noun and concept),
that try to falsify some system by getting it to behave erratically or in a manner not expected.
Think race condition checking.
These falsifications should:
